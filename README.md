# Baugh-Wooley-Multiplier
A multiplier is one of the key hardware blocks in most digital signal processing(DSP) systems. In signed multiplication, the length of the partial products and the number of partial products will be very high. So an algorithm was introduced for signed multiplication called the Baugh Wooley algorithm to enhance the speed and to reduce the critical path delay.
